# My Socialism

> In Moscow store No. 458, there was more sarcasm than bread. (Chicago Tribune, 1991)

I soiled my pajama pants. We were all watching _Home Alone_ in 1991 or something, and I was laughing so hard. True story! The eight-year-old in the movie was destroying a palatial house, the kind we had never seen, in which he had his own room. Every child had their own room in that house, so it seemed. It was beautiful inside and out. That is, before the rascal put his hands to it.

The comedy of it all was thicker for my parents. Here we were in mid-Perestroyka Moscow, all of us in one room. Every other room in the apartment, seven in total, had another family in each. One shared kitchen. One shared bathroom. A hive-worthy roach infestation. Sticky brown streaks on the walls marked the spots where the roaches congregated during winter months to leech heat from hot-water pipes running under crusty and speckled gypsum.

What can be said that Alexander Solzhenitsyn had not said? The desire for socialism is worse than socialism itself. Those who live under socialism have hope that it may one day end. Those who want socialism --- what kind of hope do they have? That the empowered can be coerced to share? By which mechanism, exactly?

Once a man asked Jesus Christ to coerce his brother to share the inheritance with him. (Luke 12:13) Jesus responded by saying, "guard yourself from every kind of greed."

Jesus Christ was not a capitalist either, but he knew well that a soul parts with a position or possessions either voluntarily or by the threat of violence. Socialism knows only the path of violence, the handmaiden of envy. You can know this for sure by observing that people rarely self-organize into socialist communities, however defined. And when they do, those communities do not generally last long.

This reality is becoming crystal clear in our modern Information Age. The chief means of production today are the engineers and the programmers. How do you transfer brains under social ownership to make socialism work? You ensnare engineers and programmers with debt and get the IRS to [prevent them from leaving](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/individuals-with-significant-tax-debt-should-act-promptly-to-avoid-revocation-of-passports).

The Soviet Iron Curtain was not built to keep enemies out. It was built to prevent people from leaving, to keep the brain-power in. Brains are the **primary** source of prosperity. They make inventions, patents, software, and silicon chips on which all industries depend to remain competitive. If the brains flee, the country falls.

In general, pitting one against the other is not suitable. Capitalism is a purely economic theory. Socialism is a failed political theory based on misguided understanding of economics. Capitalism does not have any recommendations on what government should control and how much - socialism does. As such, capitalism can floorish in many political systems, but socialism will screw any economic system that it straddles.

What about EU socialism? It is loved by the elites

Big rise in poor elderly forecast | Marcel Fratzscher, head of the Berlin-based Institute for Economic Research (DIW), told Monitor that poverty among elderly Germans would climb "very, very significantly" over the next 10 or 15 years.

The US Military Is a Socialist Organization - Affordable housing and food, tuition assistance, and universal health care are hallmarks of a social welfare system—and life in the armed forces.

> The Scandinavian nations – sometimes cited as examples of successful socialism- are not actually socialist at all, because they do not feature government ownership of the means of production, and in many ways have freer markets than most other western nations. (Ilya Somin)

there was a similar article about Sweden coming out of economic recession by ditching socialist policies, and also this: https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-of-scandinavian-socialism/

Tyranny Fallacy
Europe Fallacy - despite socialism, not because of socialism | Norway "The government’s total net cash flow from the petroleum industry is estimated to NOK 251 billion in 2018 and NOK 263 billion in 2019. This represents a significant increase in revenues compared to the last four years, mainly due to higher oil and gas prices." https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/economy/governments-revenues/ -- 16% of GDP on that site. The oil and gas sector is Norway's largest measured in terms of value added, government revenues, investments and export value

Poverty Fallacy

According to Canada Without Poverty, a not-for-profit anti-poverty organization, [1.3 million children in Canada live in poverty](https://locallove.ca/issues/heres-just-how-much-poverty-can-hold-kids-back/). (That’s a staggering one in five kids.) We live in one of the richest, most developed countries in the world, yet 4 million Canadians face food insecurity.

Greece no longer has a middle class

USSR pretended to distribute wealth by merit. When wealth declined, pretenses dropped: wealth was shared by heredity. The worst of it fell on the children of dissidents. Parents were punished by having to watch their children getting reduced to sub-human conditions by the systematic grind of the state.

2. socialism is prime for dictatorship
   3. intelligencia flee socialism
   4. infantilizes population
   5. socialism falls into deception
3. socialism promotes theft
4. socialism destroys environment

Cuban says something similar: https://nypost.com/2019/04/17/hey-democrats-heres-the-price-i-paid-for-your-socialist-dream/?utm_source=facebook_sitebuttons&utm_medium=site+buttons&utm_campaign=site+buttons&fbclid=IwAR33k761vEYw6FML4QbXf1XzgRFVylmlym6KkBYpE4BeweSzb1U0NxFQfLA

> I wish that one day I might have a conversation with some of these young American socialists, who have no experience with actually existing socialism. They like to think they can have democracy and a socialist economy. But everywhere it’s been implemented, public ownership of the means of production has led to political repression.

## Socialism Sidelines the Youth and the Elderly

- unemployment rates
- pension, retirements
- inflation

## Inability to Forecast and React to Change

Communism in 20 years was a slogan put forth by Nikita Khrushchev at the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1961. Khrushchev's quote from his speech at the Congress: "Мы руководствуемся строго научными расчетами. А расчеты показывают, что за 20 годы мы построим в основном коммунистическое общество".

USSR was 100% certain that the capitalist world would go bankrupt with most of the population descending into dire poverty.

Fixing the ills of capitalism with socialism is akin to using leeches to fight flu.

The western choice is now between flavors of socialism, and what a terrible choice it is. Socialism over-promises and under-delivers, and politicians do too.

Socialism = lost social mobility

Socialism does not eliminate the wealthy. It ensures that those who are wealthy now, and their families, will remain wealthy as long as socialism lasts.

International socialism: support FOSS.

The structure matters. Inflated regulatory government concentrates power in the hands of paper-pushers who make industry decisions, big and small, with very little knowledge of the industry. Now, being talentless, wormy, and afraid to be replaced on their jobs by another paper-pusher, the system incetivises them to lie on their reports - all their commities policy decisions become 'stellar' and 'marvelous.' Now add to that government an individual who realises he is surrounded by spinless frauds, who lie for living and who are easily intimidated or bribed. He has no competition to the top, once he gets his hands in state's security apparatus.

Why wealthy fund socialism, because spending all your billions to buy permanent power is a wise investment, and fools will not recognize the value proposition of that exchange.

Ended golden age of Russian literature, creativity and innovation, peaceful and harmless, if I cannot help, your are not helpful. -->

One memory when McDonalds was first open in Moscow (I think the largest McD in the the world is still in Moscow, may be not that one) - the line was wider than the victory parade and wrapped around a huge park. 4-7 hour wait to try a burger. We went some time (weeks?) after the opening and I saw the line with my own eyes. -->
