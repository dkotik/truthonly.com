  We are a community of volunteers developing and promoting standards of integrity in digital communications. We analyze media streams in order to detect and categorize the ways in which shared information is manipulated. Our attention is focused more on the structure and the methodology framing digital content rather than the content itself. Most members of our community read widely on many subjects, enjoy learning languages, and delve in amateur investigative research. We also enjoy the Internet, and we would like to find new ways of making it better.
