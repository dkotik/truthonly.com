legacy: We are a community of volunteers developing and promoting standards of integrity in digital communications. We analyze media streams in order to detect and categorize the ways in which shared information is manipulated. Our attention is focused more on the structure and the methodology framing digital content rather than the content itself. Most members of our community read widely on many subjects, enjoy learning languages, and delve in amateur investigative research. We also enjoy the Internet, and we would like to find new ways of making it better.

# Truth is Discovered, not Conceived

    <!-- Mis-perceived reality will be mis-addressed. -->
    <!-- The worst thing about a lie is that it occupies the place in your mind reserved for truth. -->

Hey! My name is Dima Kotik. I lived half of the my life in the East and half in the West. I scribble here occasionally to improve my writing skill by distilling banter from some of the memorable conversations I have had with my friends. A recorded thought is more lucid and concise. The process of writing challenges me to think harder to attain certitude, which I crave.
